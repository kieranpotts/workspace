= Workspace

This repository encapsulates some shell scripts and a VS Code workspace
config to install and manage all my personal code repositories.

== Requirements

link:https://git-lfs.com/[Git LFS] MUST be installed before cloning the
repositories.

== Usage

NOTE: On Windows, the workspace SHOULD be established in WSL. The `devtools`
repository SHOULD also be cloned manually directly in the host OS, and
optionally the `dotfiles` repository too.

[source,sh]
----
# Clone all repositories.
bash ./run/install.sh

# Synchronize the main branches of all local repositories with their
# tracked upstream branches.
bash ./run/sync.sh

# Open the VS Code workspace.
code ./etc/personal.code-workspace
