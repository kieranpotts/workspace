= Workspace

This repository encapsulates some shell scripts and a VS Code workspace
config to install and manage all my personal code repositories.

== Usage

IMPORTANT: The Git LFS system SHOULD be installed first, before cloning the
repositories – some require it.

[source,sh]
----
# Clone all repositories.
bash ./run/install.sh

# Synchronize the main branches of all local repositories with their
# tracked upstream branches.
bash ./run/sync.sh

# Open the VS Code workspace.
code ./etc/personal.code-workspace
