= Workspace

This repository encapsulates some shell scripts and a VS Code workspace
config to install and manage all my personal code repositories.

== Usage

IMPORTANT: The Git LFS system SHOULD be installed first, before cloning the
repositories â€“ some require it.

sh ./run/install.sh

# Synchronize the main branches of all local repositories with their
# tracked upstream branches.
sh ./run/sync.sh
